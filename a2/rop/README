INFO LEAK
    1) libc SETBUF
    2) saved EBP
By printing out stack items and dumping/slicing the relevant parts
Then we calculate offsets using s_* variable
Assumes that we know the libc used by the host (to calculate offsets)

OPEN/READ/WRITE
Normal ROP attack
The number of bytes read cannot be too big (else segfault out of the file to be read, I'm guessing)
So needs to be less than the size of the target file?? (TODO)
    If doing the above then let attacker input number of bytes to be read (he guess how big the file is)
